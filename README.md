## Inspector

This starter project is pre-configured with the `@babylonjs/inspector` package, which is a great tool to inspect your scenes and meshes. To make things easier, there's a keyboard shortcut bound to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>.

You need to be pointer locked inside the game for it to work, then just press the hotkey and you'll see the inspector panel. Press again to hide it.
